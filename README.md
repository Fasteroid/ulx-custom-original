 Custom Commands for Garry's Mod Servers

# Information
Custom ULX commands was a addon that was first uploaded to the Ulyssesmod.net forums on May 8th, 2014 by a user named Cobalt. We currently don't have any way to contact him and check to see if she/he is ok with this project. That being said, we agree to remove the project from Steam workshop and from Github should Cobalt show back up and want it taken down, so long as "Cobalt" has sufficient proof that she/he is the original uploader of the project.

# How to install
Installing is extremely simple. Simply click "Clone or download", and select "Download ZIP". After that, extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer and upload it to /garrysmod/addons ON YOUR SERVER.
If you do not know how to access your server remotely, you should contact your server provider or look up a tutorial for that provider. We will not be able to help you connect remotely to your server.

To recap what was said earlier, "we agree to remove the project from Steam workshop and from Github should Cobalt show back up and want it taken down, so long as "Cobalt" has sufficient proof that she/he is the original uploader of the project". This means that if someone proclaims to be the original author, we will not take down the project immediately until it is certain that the person claiming to be the original author, is proven to be the original author in some form. If it is proven, we will issue a warning of it's discontinuation and have the project removed from github and steam's workshop within a timely manner (5-7 business days).
