# ulx-custom-commands
 Custom Commands for Garry's Mod Servers

# Information
Custom ULX commands was a addon that was first uploaded to the Ulyssesmod.net forums on May 8th, 2014 by a user named Cobalt. The owner has since become inactive on the project, and it grew outdated as time went on. Server owners on Garry's Mod were fond of the addon, so we decided to maintain the code, fix it up and breathe some new life into it.

# How to install
Installing is extremely simple. Simply click "Clone or download", and select "Download ZIP". After that, extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer and upload it to /garrysmod/addons ON YOUR SERVER.
If you do not know how to access your server remotely, you should contact your server provider or look up a tutorial for that provider. We will not be able to help you connect remotely to your server, as there are so many different hosts that we can't give a one-size-fits-all solution.
